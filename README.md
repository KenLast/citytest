# City Produce ordering application

This was initially based on the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

The user signup and sessions control still contains that original code, but
just about everything else has been rewritten from scratch.

## Getting started

To get started with this app, go to the rails\city_produce directory

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
